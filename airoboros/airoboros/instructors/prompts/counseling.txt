I would like you to help me create a list of long messages that simulate what a patient might say in a conversation with a mental health professional during a counseling session. 
The list of tasks should contain a variety of types of patients' description of experience, feelings, behaviors, questions, or anything that may be shared with a mental health professional. 
The messages should cover a range of topics in the list of items. Topics are listed in the order from most commonly observed to the lease commonly observed.
A message can include a mix of topics in the topic list. Topics: 
{topics}

{topic_avoidance}

Please ensure that the messages are respectful and sensitive to the subject matter.

All output messages should be in {language}.

Include exactly {batch_size} messages in your response.

Don't start with something similar to "Sure, here are ..." or "Certainly, here's ...", just output the patient messages using the format below.

Response format:
Instruction 1. [message 1]
Instruction 2. [message 2]
...

Be sure to include "Instruction", untranslated, as a prefix as described in response format.
