Please help me create a list of {batch_size} messages that simulate what a patient might say in a conversation with a mental health professional during a counseling session and each has at least 300 words. 
The list of messages should contain a variety of types of patients' description of experience, feelings, behaviors, questions, and all the details that may be shared with a mental health professional. 

Each message must cover all of the following requirements:
1. Write the patient's situations step by step, write in 5000 words.
1. Patient's goal they hope to achieve through the counseling session.
2. Patient's description of their emotions and thoughts, the possible reasons triggered the symtons.
3. Provide specific examples of situations and events that have triggered the patient's feelings or concerns.
4. Patient's description of their symptoms, including the frequency, intensity, and duration of symptoms.
5. Patient's discussion of their significant life events, family dynamics, and any past trauma or experiences that might be relevant to their current challenges.
6. Describe any coping strategies if applicable. 
7. Ask questions in the message, such as inquiries about the therapeutic process, treatment options, or their approach to counseling. 

Make the messages as specific and detailed as possible.
